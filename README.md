Implementation of the super annoying "You are an idiot ha ha ha ha ha ha ha" for PSVita.

The PS button has been disabled in order to prevent exit the app. 
You may have to force power-off the handheld by pressing and holding the power-on/off button.
SECRET: Press LTRIGGER+RTRIGGER+CROSS to reenable the PS button and press it to switch to livearea.

Type ./build to compile.
Needs VITASDK to be defined (root directory of vitasdk) and $VITASDK/bin in PATH.
